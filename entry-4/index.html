        <h1>Night Notes</h1>
        <p class="entry-text">
          When the city sleeps, the room hums in a soft silence.  
          The lamp on my desk becomes the only witness — its glow breathing softly,  
          wrapping the walls in a thin golden film.  
          Every night feels like a rehearsal for solitude,  
          where stillness carries more meaning than words ever could.

          <p class="entry-text">
            The lamp’s light never floods — it settles, humbly.  
            It teaches me to see in gradients rather than absolutes.  
            Under its glow, time thickens; each breath, each blink,  
            feels like a quiet promise between me and the night.

            The light stretches across paper and glass,  
            tracing small constellations on the desk.  
            It reminds me how fragile focus can be —  
            one shadow misplaced, and the whole world changes tone.  
            Still, I keep the lamp on, as if its warmth holds the night together.

          <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/1200x/7c/29/5a/7c295a912bb700baba67b9de42da5bb4.jpg" alt="Desk">
          <p class="entry-text">
            On the desk lies an unfinished note, a cold mug, a folded paper.  
            Each object speaks softly about habit — about returning to the same place,  
            hoping to think differently. The light lands on these small proofs of presence,  
            whispering that quiet persistence is a kind of faith.

          <p class="entry-text">
            When I turn off the lamp, the darkness doesn’t feel empty — it feels vast.  
            The last shimmer lingers on the wall, dissolving into something dreamlike.  
            I like to think that light never disappears, it just hides somewhere  
            inside the quiet, waiting to be found again.
