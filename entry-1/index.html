      Every morning begins with the same ritual, the warmth between my hands, the slow curl of steam, the first bitter breath.  
      In this moment, I exist quietly between sleep and wakefulness. Coffee isnâ€™t just a drink; it is a mirror of rhythm and patience,  
      a pause that lets the day begin with awareness.

    <h1>Taste of Coffee</h1>
    <p class="entry-text">
      Bitterness is never just about flavor. The first sip holds a small resistance, a faint sting that wakes the senses.  
      As warmth spreads, it turns softer, almost kind. It reminds me that emotions too can taste bitter before they become understanding.

    <p class="entry-text">
      The sunlight falls through the kitchen window and touches the surface of my coffee.  
      Light and liquid blend into a brief shimmer, like time itself melting into warmth.  
      Every morning, I watch this small performance of light and think about how beauty often hides in repetition.

    <h1>Memory of Coffee</h1>
    <p class="entry-text">
      My mother used to stir sugar three times, always with quiet hands.  
      I still follow her rhythm though I drink mine black now. It is strange how repetition becomes remembrance.  
      Maybe memory, like coffee, is a ritual that survives time through warmth.
