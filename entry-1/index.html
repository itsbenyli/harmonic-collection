                Sometimes the day starts before I’m really awake, but the coffee arrives on its own time.
              </p>
              <p class="panel-body">
                I wrap both hands around the cup and let the heat sink into my skin, like it’s reminding me that I still have a body, not just a list of things I have to do. The steam rises slowly, carrying this quiet, familiar smell that makes the room feel less sharp around the edges.
              </p>
              <p class="panel-body">
                The first sip always catches me a little off guard. Not because of the bitterness, but because it reminds me I’m still here — awake, breathing, trying. There’s a rhythm to it: cup to lips, breath in, breath out. It’s such an ordinary motion, but somehow it holds the whole morning together.
              </p>
              <p class="panel-body">
                In that small pause, before I check my phone, before I speak to anyone, I get to decide how I want to exist today — even if it’s just for a moment.

                When the light hits the surface just right, the coffee becomes a small moving mirror.
              </p>
              <p class="panel-body">
                Tiny reflections shiver across the top of the cup — window frames, bits of sky, the outline of my own face breaking and reforming with each small movement. It’s almost nothing, but I find myself staring like it’s saying something I can’t quite translate.
              </p>
              <p class="panel-body">
                In those seconds, the scene feels like it’s already a memory. The present moment slides into the past while I’m still inside it. Light, shadow, steam, the curve of the cup — everything arranging itself into a quiet story I won’t be able to repeat in exactly the same way.
              </p>
              <p class="panel-body">
                Maybe that’s why I keep coming back to this ritual. It doesn’t demand anything from me. It just shows me how temporary even the softest moments are, and somehow, that makes them feel more real.

                There’s always a moment right before the last sip where everything feels strangely calm.
              </p>
              <p class="panel-body">
                The light has shifted a little. The room has woken up. Somewhere outside, the day has already started running, but inside this small circle of warmth, time moves slower. The coffee has cooled, the steam has faded, but the comfort is still there, sitting quietly at the bottom of the cup.
              </p>
              <p class="panel-body">
                In that stillness, I don’t feel like I have to be anything more than a person holding a mug, just existing in a chair, in a room, in a sliver of morning light. No performance, no rush, no polished version of myself — just me, as I am, which somehow feels like the hardest thing to be.
              </p>
              <p class="panel-body">
                When I finally drink the last drop, it feels less like an ending and more like a small agreement with myself: I made it through the beginning of today. Whatever happens next, at least I had this.

                My mother used to stir her coffee three times, even when there was nothing left to dissolve.
              </p>
              <p class="panel-body">
                As a kid, I thought it was just a habit. Now I think it was a way of slowing down, a tiny ceremony to make the moment feel like it mattered. I catch myself doing the same motion sometimes — circling the spoon in an empty cup, listening to the soft clink against the porcelain, as if I’m borrowing her hands for a second.
              </p>
              <p class="panel-body">
                These small repetitions follow me into my own mornings. The way I hold the cup. The way I lean on the counter. The way I stare at nothing in particular while the coffee cools. They are not big memories, not dramatic or important, but they’re the ones that stay.
              </p>
              <p class="panel-body">
                Maybe all these quiet rituals are just our way of saying to ourselves: I’m still here. I’m still learning how to be alive in a world that moves too fast. Coffee isn’t really the point. It’s just the place I return to, so I can return to myself for a few slow breaths before stepping back into everything else.
