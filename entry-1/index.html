        <h1>Coffee</h1>
        <p class="entry-text">
          Every morning begins with the same ritual, the warmth between my hands, the slow curl of steam, the first bitter breath.  
          Coffee isn’t just a drink; it is a mirror of rhythm and patience, a pause that lets the day begin with awareness.

          <p class="entry-text">The aroma rises slowly, mingling with the morning air. Each sip marks a gentle beginning, a reminder that simple rituals carry the weight of our memories. The way the light hits the steam, the heat warming my palms—this moment is quiet, yet full, a meditation in action.</p>

          <p class="entry-text">The liquid glimmers in the sunlight as it dances inside the cup. Shadows and light perform an unspoken choreography. Watching this tiny play, I reflect on patience and presence, realizing that even mundane acts hold poetry if we pause to notice.</p>

          <p class="entry-text">The first sunlight filtering through the window touches the coffee surface like a gentle brushstroke. Time feels suspended in these early moments. Light becomes a language, painting warmth into the room, and I linger in the quiet dialogue between daybreak and the stillness of the kitchen.</p>

          <p class="entry-text">My mother’s hands, always steady, always quiet, stirring sugar three times. I trace her gestures in mine, though my coffee is black now. Memory lingers in repetition; each action becomes a thread connecting past and present. In every sip, a ritual, a story, a gentle echo of love and care.</p>
