    <p class="dream-text">
      I move through the world as if through a softened mirror,  
      edges bending, light drifting, colors loosening into haze.  
      There is always that brief moment before waking—  
      the second where I am not myself yet,  
      where memory and imagination overlap  
      like two silhouettes trying to become one.
    </p>

    <p class="dream-text">
      As I walk through this shifting surface,  
      I see versions of myself reflected back—  
      some younger, some quieter,  
      some still reaching for things I’ve already let go of.  
      They linger in the glass the way dreams do:  
      not quite real, not quite forgotten,  
      hovering in the space between becoming and being.
    </p>

    <p class="dream-text">
      Stepping forward feels like moving deeper into the mirror,  
      every gesture revealing a little more of the figure behind the fog.  
      My reflection sharpens slowly,  
      not because it becomes real,  
      but because I finally allow myself to look.
    </p>

    <p class="dream-text">
      By the time I reach the end,  
      the dream no longer blurs—  
      it folds into the shape of the present,  
      quiet, steady, whole.
