    <p class="main-text">
      I watch myself in fragments—<br>
      small moments returning like soft echoes,<br>
      carrying pieces of who I used to be,<br>
      and the versions of me that never fully disappeared.
    </p>

    <p class="main-text">
      Childhood feels like a place I keep trying to revisit,<br>
      not through memory alone, but through sensations—<br>
      the warmth of a late afternoon,<br>
      the uneven rhythm of running without purpose,<br>
      the blurry laughter of a smaller world where nothing felt urgent.<br><br>
      Back then, time did not move forward;<br>
      it simply gathered around me, gentle and wide.
    </p>

    <p class="main-text">
      As I grew older, the edges of that world sharpened.<br>
      Rooms became smaller, decisions heavier,<br>
      and I learned that silence could carry meaning<br>
      instead of simply being the space before the next game.<br><br>
      Yet when I watch these old fragments,<br>
      I recognize something steady:<br>
      a softness I once lived inside<br>
      that I am still trying to understand.
    </p>

    <p class="main-text">
      Growing up is not a leaving—it is a layering.<br>
      Every version of myself stands somewhere inside me,<br>
      still watching, still learning,<br>
      still reaching toward the world with open hands.<br><br>
      And maybe the reason these old images feel so alive<br>
      is because they remind me<br>
      that I did not lose anything at all—<br>
      I simply became someone who could carry more.
    </p>

    <p class="main-text">
      So I let the film run.<br>
      I let the colors fade and return,<br>
      let the frame tremble, let the light spill.<br><br>
      In these imperfect recordings,<br>
      I see not just who I was,<br>
      but the tenderness of becoming—<br>
      the quiet proof that even now,<br>
      I am still in motion,<br>
      still unfolding,<br>
      still learning how to be whole.
    </p>
