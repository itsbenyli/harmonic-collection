        <h1>Small Proofs</h1>
        <p class="entry-text">
          I keep small things — a receipt, a ticket, a stone —  
          not because they matter, but because they remind me that moments once did.  
          These objects carry the quiet weight of passing time,  
          fragile evidence that I was here, feeling something worth remembering.
        </p>

        <div class="image-section" id="receipt">

          <p class="entry-text">
            The receipt’s faded ink still shows the name of a café,  
            the date, the small cost of a quiet afternoon.  
            I remember the smell of coffee, the hum of soft conversation.  
            Some moments never grow old; they just turn lighter,  
            like paper slowly surrendering to air and time.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="image-section reverse" id="ticket">
          <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/1200x/e1/da/a0/e1daa00fd4d032ffa61b62c1aa96a0ee.jpg" alt="Ticket">
          <p class="entry-text">
            The ticket feels heavier than it looks —  
            not in weight, but in memory.  
            It once promised distance, a train to somewhere unfamiliar.  
            I didn’t know then that leaving could also mean collecting —  
            sounds, faces, fragments that never quite leave you.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="image-section" id="pebble">
          <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/a7/a7/67/a7a7670735d4955b24b5a5f493e9a71a.jpg" alt="Pebble">
          <p class="entry-text">
            A smooth pebble from a nameless shore.  
            I found it when I wasn’t looking for anything.  
            It sits on my desk now, unchanged, patient.  
            Sometimes I hold it just to feel its quiet permanence —  
            a kind of peace that doesn’t need to be explained.
