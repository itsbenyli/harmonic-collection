    <div class="entry-text">
      <p>Sometimes I find small objects in my pocket — a ticket, a pebble, a note folded in half. They are not important, but they remind me that time leaves traces.</p>
      <p>Each thing carries a quiet story: a train ride, a walk by the river, a moment I almost forgot. I keep them not because they matter, but because they hold the rhythm of everyday life.</p>
      <p>When I look at them together, I see a map of small choices. It feels like an archive built by accident — an honest record of passing time.</p>
      <p>Maybe harmony is made from these fragments, from the way I decide to keep what would otherwise be lost.</p>
