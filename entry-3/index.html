        <h1>Window</h1>

        <p class="entry-text">
          The window is the quietest part of my room—  
          not because it makes no sound,  
          but because everything beyond the glass feels softened  
          as if distance itself is a kind of mercy.  
          <br><br>
          When I sit in front of it, I feel the world slow down.  
          Light stretches across the walls,  
          shadows drift with the rhythm of passing clouds,  
          and the city becomes a moving painting  
          that expects nothing from me.  
          <br><br>
          Through the window, I can watch life without needing to enter it.  
          I can let my thoughts wander  
          in the safety of observation—  
          half in the world,  
          half tucked inside myself.  
        </p>

          <p class="entry-text">
            When the glass brightens,  
            the dust in the air becomes tiny constellations,  
            suspended in a moment too brief to hold.  
            <br><br>
            Everything looks slightly unreal—  
            like the world is trying on a gentler version of itself.  
            Buildings glow,  
            color deepens,  
            and even familiar streets feel touched by something soft  
            and temporary.  
            <br><br>
            A window doesn’t change anything,  
            yet it changes how I see.  
            It reminds me that perspective  
            is sometimes all I have control over.

          <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/1200x/0c/0c/de/0c0cde0a210967e57aac5a313687b743.jpg" alt="Rain View">
          <p class="entry-text">
            Rain turns the window into a moving watercolor—  
            every drop dragging its own story down the glass.  
            <br><br>
            The world outside dissolves,  
            bending into streaks of color and light  
            that shift and gather like emotional weather.  
            Cars blur into lines,  
            people become silhouettes,  
            and the city exhales  
            in long, quiet breaths.  
            <br><br>
            Rain always pulls me inward.  
            It reminds me how easily things change shape—  
            memories, feelings,  
            even the way I imagine myself.  
            <br><br>
            The window holds all of it  
            without ever asking me to explain.
