    <h1>Window</h1>
    <p class="entry-text">
      Every morning light seeps through the window like a quiet visitor.  
      It draws slow lines across the wall, reminding me of time’s soft rhythm.  
      Through this framed space, the world outside and my inner world meet.  
      I see myself not as a watcher, but as part of that subtle conversation.

    <h1>Morning Light</h1>
    <p class="entry-text">
      The early sun feels gentle, like a whisper touching the surface of the room.  
      It does not force its way in; it lingers, stretching over the desk, the plants, the curtains.  
      I think about how light reveals not just space but emotion—how each angle glows differently depending on how I feel.

    <h1>Rain View</h1>
    <p class="entry-text">
      Raindrops blur the city into watercolor.  
      Each droplet carries a small reflection of the sky, the buildings, the moving cars.  
      Watching them slide down the glass, I realize how harmony sometimes means letting things lose their sharpness.  
      The world softens, and I do too.

<!-- <REFLECT> -->

  <div class="entry-container">
    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <p class="entry-text">
      At night the glass becomes a mirror.  
      My face merges with the faint glow of the city lights.  
      It’s strange—how reflection is both real and unreal,  
      a reminder that self-awareness always flickers between what is seen and what is imagined.
