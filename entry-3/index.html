        <p class="entry-text">
          The window has become a quiet stage in my days—  
          a frame that holds the world while asking nothing of me.  
          Sometimes the light pours through in a clean, unwavering sheet,  
          other times it trembles with passing shadows,  
          and I watch the city rearrange itself in silence.  
          <br><br>
          From here, life doesn’t rush at me the way it does outside.  
          It moves at a distance, softened by glass,  
          and I begin to notice patterns I never see when I’m part of the noise—  
          the rhythm of people walking,  
          the hesitation of a bird before it takes flight,  
          the way afternoon light settles on rooftops  
          like it has all the time in the world.  
          <br><br>
          A window is a strange kind of companion:  
          close enough to show me what I’m missing,  
          gentle enough not to judge what I’m feeling.  
          It is both a pause and an invitation—  
          a thin line between observation and longing.

          <p class="entry-text">
            Some days the glass looks almost invisible,  
            and I forget there’s something separating me from the scene beyond it.  
            I catch glimpses of colors shifting,  
            of air folding between buildings,  
            of moments too fragile to name.  
            <br><br>
            Light refracts against the pane, catching dust in midair,  
            turning it into a constellation that only exists in this room,  
            in this second.  
            These tiny details—normally ignored—become small reminders  
            that perception isn’t fixed.  
            It breathes. It moves.  
            It tilts depending on the angle of my attention.  
            <br><br>
            Every time I look out, the world rearranges itself,  
            and so do I.  
            Maybe that’s why windows are comforting—  
            they let me witness change  
            without being asked to keep up with it.

          <p class="entry-text">
            When rain arrives, the window becomes something else entirely—  
            a blurred watercolor,  
            a shifting veil that softens every edge.  
            Raindrops slide down the glass in uncertain paths,  
            bending the city lights into liquid threads.  
            <br><br>
            I watch buildings melt into pools of color,  
            cars stretch into ribbon-like streaks,  
            and people turn into silhouettes moving gently through the blur.  
            The entire world slows down,  
            as if the rain is telling it to exhale.  
            <br><br>
            And somehow, in the distortion, things feel clearer.  
            Every drop mirrors a thought I didn’t know I was holding—  
            the kind that only surfaces when everything else is quiet.  
            <br><br>
            Rain has a way of making the ordinary feel intimate.  
            It turns the city inward,  
            turns me inward too,  
            and I’m reminded of how fragile and temporary everything is—  
            not in a sad way,  
            but in a way that makes me want to pay closer attention  
            to the moments that pass,  
            even the ones that seem small.
