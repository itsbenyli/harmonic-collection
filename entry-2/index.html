    <p class="entry-text">
      The train hums beneath the city, a heartbeat made of motion and metal.  
      Every ride carries silence, vibration, and faces reflected in the glass.  
      Between noise and stillness, I learn to listen to rhythm—  
      not of music, but of life itself.

    <h2>Door</h2>
    <p class="entry-text">
      The doors open and close like breaths—each sound a beginning and an end.  
      When they slide apart, light rushes in; when they seal shut, silence returns.  
      I think about how often we cross thresholds without noticing the change.

    <p class="entry-text">
      The map glows faintly, a net of colored veins across the city.  
      Every line leads somewhere, yet I trace them to remember where I have been.  
      Routine folds into pattern, and pattern becomes comfort.

    <h2>Earphone</h2>
    <p class="entry-text">
      With earphones on, the world blurs into rhythm.  
      Music folds around me like a thin wall, soft and private.  
      I watch people’s lips move without sound,  
      and realize isolation can sometimes feel like peace.
